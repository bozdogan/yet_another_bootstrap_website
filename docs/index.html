  <title>bozdogan: Yet Another Bootstrap Website! (Mercifully Closed)</title>
</head>
<body>

<main>
  <h1>This site has been closed</h1>
  
  <p>That website was a part of a school project. Since it fulfilled its purpose during 2019 spring season, it is no longer needed to be open to visitors. To save myself from this embarrassment, I'm closing this website once and for all. Thanks for visiting my website during this time if you did.</p>
  
  <p>You can follow me on twitter if you'd like. (Note that I'm posting Turkish there.)</p>
    
  <p>Sincerely,<br>
